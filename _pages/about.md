I'm Zixiao Wang, a 20-year-old undergraduate student majoring in Robotics Engineering at South China University of Technology, based in Panyu District, Guangzhou.

I’ve participated in diverse projects—from digital human action optimization and flood prediction modeling to bionic manipulator development and biped robot training—and am currently working on the "Embodied Grasping in Stacked Scenarios" project.
